## Presentation

* Selected topic
  - We chose to work on an anime dataset.

  - From kaggle, [link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreuvallhernndez/myanimelist), sourced from MyAnimeList.com
* Questions to answer from data
  - Our goal is to predict potential ratings of anime in correlation with release dates.
