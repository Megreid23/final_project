## Presentation

* Selected topic
  - We chose to work on an anime dataset. This dataset covers the title, the type (TV or movie), episode count, and the starting date and season for each release.
* Reason for selected topic
  - It appealed to our group as an interesting topic to work on, being that the majority of us are fans of anime. It also has a relevant academic interest for us, as our achieving goal (to predict if the time of release effects projected ratings) might help us predict potential releases for new seasons.
* Description of data source
  - From kaggle, [link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreuvallhernndez/myanimelist). Sourced from MyAnimeList.com, a popular website devoted to detailing information about different animes/donghua.
* Questions to answer from data
  - Our goal is to predict potential ratings of anime in correlation with release dates.
* Communication protocols
  - We decided that utilizing class time to work on the project will suffice, as well as use a dedicated Slack groupchat to communicate with one another, to keep up to date on progress and establish extra meetings if necessary.
