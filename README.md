## Presentation

* Selected topic
  - We choose to work on an anime dataset.
* Reason for selected topic
  - Because it sounded like fun.
* Description of data source
  - From kaggle, [link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreuvallhernndez/myanimelist), sourced from MyAnimeList.com
* Questions to answer from data
  - Our goal is to predict potential ratings of anime in correlation with release dates.
* Communication protocols
  - We decided that utilizing class time to work on the project will suffice, as well as use a dedicated Slack groupchat to communicate with one another, to keep up to date on progress and establish extra meetings if necessary.
